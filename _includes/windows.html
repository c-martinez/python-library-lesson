			<p><b>OpenRefine</b>
				<br/>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning
				that runs through a web browser, and any browser -
				Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer - should work fine.
				You will need to download OpenRefine and install it,

				an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.

					</li>
